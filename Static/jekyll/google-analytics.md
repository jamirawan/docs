# Settup Google Analytics tracking on Jekyll page

Depending on the theme you are using, it can be varies. Basically you need to add the GA tracking ID into the `_config.yml` then added into the `<head></head>` somewhere in the html file. 

*I can not embed the code as it rendered in MD and confused the _config.yml file*

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
