# Blockquotes

*Important:*
- Space is needed after the marker `>`;
- You could just add only one `>` at the first line;
- Blockquotes can be nested
- Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a >  between the paragraphs.
- Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. But not all elements can be used.
