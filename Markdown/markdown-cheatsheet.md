*Or with `<>`*

<https://www.markdownguide.org>  
<fake@example.com>

*But, to prevent automated linking*

 `https://www.example.com`

*Or add emphasize*

I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.  
This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*.  
See the section on [`code`](#code).

## 10. Reference-style Links

I also know [etymology of Indonesia][2]  
I knew [History of Indonesia][3]

[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia>
[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia#Etymology "Etymology of Indonesia"
[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia#History 'History of Indonesia'

*Or, put reference in text*

It was a [hobbit-hole][hh], and that means comfort.

[hh]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> "Hobbit lifestyles"

*But, be careful with spaces in the links, put `%20` as space*

[example without %20](https://www.example.com/my great page)
