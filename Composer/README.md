# Composer

![Composer logo](https://getcomposer.org/img/logo-composer-transparent3.png)

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP, it lets you declare the libraries your project depend on and will manage them either installing or updating them. It's not a package manager like `yum` or `apt` but it's more like Node's `npm` or Ruby's `bundler`
