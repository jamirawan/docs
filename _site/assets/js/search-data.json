Go to the directory `cd web-app` after the installation done and we can start running the Laravel Sail that providfe a simple CLI for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration: ```terminal docker-compose up -d #or ./vendor/bin/sail up - d ``` With alias setup: `sail up -d` (refer to 'Sail' section for alias setup) Ensure that the port you are using, by default it's :80, is not in use by other Docker containers. If it's already used and the following error came up, you can change the port number or kill other containers first: ### Check who uses port (number) Run this to check who's using the port number you wish to list: ```terminal sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep ``` ### Change port ```terminal ERROR: for mailhog Cannot start service mailhog: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint web-app_mailhog_1 (ae8085daf269cf4a0f7eae07927d10a0975d5ae3a082659314663956afce36c1): Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8025: bind: address already in use ERROR: for laravel.test Cannot start service laravel.test: Ports are not available: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:80: bind: address already in use ``` You can change the port number Change to other ports by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file: ```yml ports: - \"8084:80\" ``` And try to use port 8084 instaed `http://localhost:8084` ### Stop and remove containers ```terminal docker-compose down # Stop container on current dir if there is a docker-compose.yml ``` And then run the up the sail again: `./vendor/bin/sail up` or `sail up -d` if you have your alias setup. This may take a few minutes but you'll see this line where you can check your web app: ```terminal laravel.test_1 | Starting Laravel development server: http://0.0.0.0:80 ``` So your project web local web app is: `http://0.0.0.0:80` or just `localhost` ",

This command will publish Sail's docker-compose.yml file to the root of your application: ```terminal php artisan sail:install ``` By default, to run the sail it's : `.vendor/bin/sail up -d` ## Setup alias Instead of typing all those path, you should make an alias on the bash profile. Run these command and you don't have to edit the .bash profile: ```terminal export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml alias sail='bash vendor/bin/sail' ``` ## Commands ### Start & stop Start: ```terminal sail up ``` Start with `detached mode`: ```terminal sail up -d ``` To stop all containers: ```terminal sail down ``` ### Executing ",

Code *Notes:* - Inline codes is written inside \\` \\` - or idented by add four spaces or one tab before ***Makdown*** ```md This is inline `code`. ``` ***Rendered output*** This is inline `code`. For a block of codes add three backward single quotes ***Makdown*** ````md ``` javascript var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\"; alert(s); ``` ```python s = \"Python syntax highlighting\" print s ``` ```` ***Rendered output*** ```javascript var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\"; alert(s); ``` ```python s = \"Python syntax highlighting\" print s ``` ## Escaping markdown code block To escape block code as above in Markdown with three backticks, use either four backticks or three ~~~ --- ## 9. Links **Example** This is [link](https://irawan.io)) This is [link with title](https://irawan.io \"Irawan's site\") *Or, directly put the link* https://example.com/ fake@example.com *Or with ``* *But, to prevent automated linking* `https://www.example.com` *Or add emphasize* This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*. See the section on [`code`](#code). *Or, put reference in text* It was a [hobbit-hole][hh], and that means comfort. [hh]: \"Hobbit lifestyles\" *But, be careful with spaces in the links, put `%20` as space* [example %20 link](https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page) [example without %20](https://www.example.com/my great page) --- ## 11. Images *Notes:* - It is not recommended to use image links in reference format. Some apps will not preview those images. - Specifying size of image is supported only in some extended markdown (such as *markdown-it*). ***Makdown*** ```md ![Irawan's Image](https://irawan.io/og/irawan-io.png) ``` ***Rendered output*** ![Irawan's Image](https://irawan.io/og/irawan-io.png) ## 12 Horizontal lines ***Markdown*** ```md ___ --- *** ``` ***Rendered output*** ___ --- *** ``` ",
