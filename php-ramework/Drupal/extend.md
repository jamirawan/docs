# Extend Drupal

Drupal like other CMS or open source platform is so extendable with modules and themes available from the community. The Drupal community I found it is amazing and very supportive. 

## Installing module and theme with `composer`

To install Drupal module or theme with composer you can just simply run 
```bash
composer require drupal/module_name
```

Example above is for a drupal project called `module_name` and in Drupal page it will be after /project/ folder: `https://drupal.org/project/module_name`
