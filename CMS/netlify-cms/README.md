# Netlify CMS



[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is not the netlify.app but the Content Management System for website built Git workflows. 

It's core is React and wrapping around the Git workflow through Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket API. 

Netlify CMS is not all about using command line and code editor to post and edit contents but it also has the non-developer editor friendly back end login.
